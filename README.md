# Starfield Cartography Data

This repository contains data and scripts used to reconcile **Starfield’s in-game star records** with real astronomical sources.

## Files

### `NewStars.csv`

* Derived from `NewStarsData_WithMismatches.csv`.
* Updated, hand edited, final star table.
* Incorporates additional *Starfield* metadata.

---

## First Pass

### `SimbadLookup.py`

* Python script that queries the SIMBAD database using [astroquery](https://astroquery.readthedocs.io).
* Applies corrections for lookup mismatches and game-derived adjustments.
* Produces `NewStarsData.csv` with updated identifiers and astrophysical values.

### `NewStarsData.csv`

* Generated by `SimbadLookup.py`.
* Matches stars from the base game (`stars.csv`) to real-world astronomical entries in SIMBAD.
* Retains original fields and adds new ones (aliases, positions, photometry, etc.).

### `Corrections_Report.csv`

* Provenance log created during SIMBAD reconciliation.
* Records mismatches, overrides, and applied corrections.

### `stardata.csv`, `stars.csv`

* Base game star tables extracted from *Starfield*’s `Misc.ba2`.
* Serve as the foundation for matching and verification.
* Bundled here for reference.

### `starsDebug.csv`

* Test subset used for rapid iteration and debugging.

---

## Second Pass

These files compare SIMBAD-matched data (`NewStarsData.csv`) against several in-game **STDT** form values:

### `StarFormToNewStarsCompare.py`

* Automates the STDT-vs-SIMBAD comparison.

### `NewStarsData_WithMismatches.csv`

* Highlights discrepancies between SIMBAD values and STDT records.

### `StarFormData.csv`

* Extracted STDT form data used for comparison.

### `StarMismatchReport.csv`

* Consolidated report summarizing mismatches and reconciliation notes.

---

## Other Files

### `MatchedPlanets.csv`

* Derived from the [exoplanet.eu](https://exoplanet.eu) catalog.
* Lists confirmed exoplanets orbiting stars that also appear in *Starfield*.

---

## Usage

Run `SimbadLookup.py` with a base game star file:

```bash
python SimbadLookup.py --file stars.csv
```

Produces:

* `NewStarsData.csv` — SIMBAD-matched data
* `Corrections_Report.csv` — provenance record

`NewStars.csv`:

* Derived from `NewStarsData.csv`
* Integrates STDT, PNDT, and additional reconciliation scripts
* Represents the **final**, game-relevant star dataset

---

## Methods

* Data retrieved via the **astroquery SIMBAD interface** (CDS, Strasbourg).
* Variance between game values and catalog data is flagged for transparency.
