# Starfield Cartography Data

This repository contains data and scripts used to reconcile **Starfield’s in-game star records** with real astronomical sources.

## Files

### `NewStars.csv`

* Derived from `NewStarsData_WithMismatches.csv`.
* Updated, hand edited, final star table.
* Incorporates additional *Starfield* metadata.

---

## First Pass

### `SimbadLookup.py`

* Python script that queries the SIMBAD database using [astroquery](https://astroquery.readthedocs.io).
* Applies corrections for lookup mismatches and game-derived adjustments.
* Produces `NewStarsData.csv` with updated identifiers and astrophysical values.

### `NewStarsData.csv`

* Generated by `SimbadLookup.py`.
* Matches stars from the base game (`stars.csv`) to real-world astronomical entries in SIMBAD.
* Retains original fields and adds new ones (aliases, positions, photometry, etc.).

### `Corrections_Report.csv`

* Provenance log created during SIMBAD reconciliation.
* Records mismatches, overrides, and applied corrections.

### `stardata.csv`, `stars.csv`

* Base game star tables extracted from *Starfield*’s `Misc.ba2`.
* Serve as the foundation for matching and verification.
* Bundled here for reference.

### `starsDebug.csv`

* Test subset used for rapid iteration and debugging.

---

## Second Pass

These files compare SIMBAD-matched data (`NewStarsData.csv`) against several in-game **STDT** form values:

### `StarFormToNewStarsCompare.py`

* Automates the STDT-vs-SIMBAD comparison.

### `NewStarsData_WithMismatches.csv`

* Highlights discrepancies between SIMBAD values and STDT records.

### `StarFormData.csv`

* Extracted STDT form data used for comparison.

### `StarMismatchReport.csv`

* Consolidated report summarizing mismatches between real star data and game star data.

---

## Other Files

### `MatchExoplanets.py`
* Derived from NewStarsData.csv and the [exoplanet.eu](https://exoplanet.eu) catalog as (`exoplanet.eu.csv`).
* Matches Starfield stars to real exoplanets from the exoplanet.eu catalog.

### `MatchedPlanets.csv`
* Lists confirmed exoplanets orbiting stars that also appear in *Starfield*.

Here’s a corrected **Usage** section that matches your *current* workflow and file relationships.
It stays concise, accurate, and consistent with the earlier sections.

## Usage

### **1. Run the first-pass SIMBAD lookup**

Generates the primary astronomical dataset.

```bash
python SimbadLookup.py --file stars.csv
```

Produces:

* `NewStarsData.csv` — SIMBAD-matched star data
* `Corrections_Report.csv` — provenance and correction log

---

### **2. Run the second-pass comparison (optional)**

Compares SIMBAD results to in-game STDT form values.

```bash
python StarFormToNewStarsCompare.py
```

Produces:

* `NewStarsData_WithMismatches.csv` — SIMBAD vs. STDT discrepancies
* `StarMismatchReport.csv` — consolidated mismatch summary

---

### **3. (Optional) Match real exoplanets**

Cross-reference SIMBAD-matched stars with the exoplanet.eu catalog.

```bash
python MatchExoplanets.py
```

Produces:

* `MatchedPlanets.csv` — confirmed exoplanets associated with *Starfield* stars

---

## Methods

* Data retrieved via the **astroquery SIMBAD interface** (CDS, Strasbourg).
* Variance between game values and catalog data is flagged for transparency.
