# Starfield Cartography Data

This repository contains data and scripts used to reconcile **Starfield’s in‑game star catalog** with real astronomical sources.

## Files

### `MatchedPlanets.csv`
- Derived from the [exoplanet.eu](https://exoplanet.eu) database.  
- Contains confirmed exoplanets that belong to stars appearing in *Starfield*.  

### `NewStars.csv`
- Generated by `SimbadLookup.py`.  
- Matches stars from `stars.csv` (old base game file) to real astronomical data via SIMBAD.  
- Retains most original fields, adds new ones (aliases, coordinates, photometry).  

### `SimbadLookup.py`
- Python script that queries the SIMBAD database using [astroquery](https://astroquery.readthedocs.io).  
- Applies corrections for lookup mismatches and game data changes.  
- Produces `NewStars.csv` with updated identifiers and astrophysical fields.

### `stardata.csv`, `stars.csv`
- Base game files extracted from *Starfield*’s `- Misc.ba2` archive.  
- Serve as the foundation for matching and reconciliation.  
- Copies included for reference.

## Methods
- Data retrieval via **astroquery SIMBAD interface** (CDS, Strasbourg). 
- Variance between game and catalog values flagged for transparency.

## Attribution
This work makes use of the **SIMBAD database**, operated at CDS, Strasbourg, France.  
Exoplanet data sourced from [exoplanet.eu](https://exoplanet.eu).
