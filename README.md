# Starfield Cartography Data

This repository contains data and scripts used to reconcile **Starfield’s in‑game stars** with real astronomical sources.

## Files

### `MatchedPlanets.csv`
- Derived from the [exoplanet.eu](https://exoplanet.eu) database.  
- Contains confirmed exoplanets that belong to stars appearing in *Starfield*.  

### `NewStars.csv`
- Updated 'NewStarsData.csv' that includes more relavent game info.  
- Matches data from 'NewStarsData.csv' against the in-game STDT form values. 

### `NewStarsData.csv`
- Generated by `SimbadLookup.py`.  
- Matches stars from `stars.csv` (old base game file) to real astronomical data via SIMBAD.  
- Retains most original fields, adds new ones (aliases, coordinates, photometry). 

### `SimbadLookup.py`
- Python script that queries the SIMBAD database using [astroquery](https://astroquery.readthedocs.io).  
- Applies corrections for lookup mismatches and game data changes.  
- Produces `NewStars.csv` with updated identifiers and astrophysical fields.
  
### `stardata.csv`, `stars.csv`
- Base game files extracted from *Starfield*’s `- Misc.ba2` archive.  
- Serve as the foundation for matching and reconciliation.  
- Copies included for reference.

### `starsDebug.csv`
- Query test file.

## Usage
Run SimbadLookup.py with a base game star file:
    python SimbadLookup.py --file stars.csv

Outputs:
    - NewStarsData.csv (matched SIMBAD data)
    - Corrections_Report.csv (provenance log)

NewStars.csv:
    - Derived from NewStarsData.csv
    - Incorporates STDT, PNDT, and other reconciliation scripts
    - Represents the final, game-relevant star dataset

## Methods
- Data retrieval via **astroquery SIMBAD interface** (CDS, Strasbourg). 
- Variance between game and catalog values flagged for transparency.

## Attribution
